# Assignment 03 - Point Statistics

As usual, please fork this assignment to your own repository and
clone the code locally to your computer.  In contrast to previous weeks,
this week you do not need to fix any tests.  I have already created the
tests for you.  The file `point_pattern.py` contains five functions (we will
cover what a function is in a future week).  These are:

1. `manhattan_distance`
1. `euclidean_distance`
1. `shift_point`
1. `check_coincident`
1. `check_in`

I have removed sections of logic from these and noted the removal with a
comment.  Your assignment is to use the operators/operands from the weekly
readings to fill in the logic.  Once the logic is added, you can locally
run the tests as a check.

Once you are happy with your assignment, go ahead and submit a pull request.
If TravisCI shows an error (red X in the pull request) feel free to update
your repository (`git add -A .`, `git commit`, `git push origin master`).  Please
*do not* open more than one pull request.
